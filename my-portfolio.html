            A software developer is a professional who creates and improves software applications and systems. They use programming skills to design, write, debug, and execute code to build software for a variety of purposes, including operating systems, mobile apps, video games, and more. Software developers may also perform upgrades and maintenance on software after it's released to customers. 
            Software developers typically work in teams with other software developers, engineers, or computer programmers. They may collaborate with graphic designers and product managers to bring an idea to life. 
            Software developers may have different areas of focus, such as applications, systems, or web development: 
            Applications software developers
            Create applications for consumers, such as games, or custom software for specific customers 
            Systems software developers
            Create operating systems for the public or for organizations, and may also build the user interface 
            Web developers
            Create and maintain computer applications and systems, but focus on websites, performance, capacity, and content creation 
            To become a software developer, you can pursue a formal education, such as a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field. You can also enroll in a coding bootcamp to learn the basic skills needed for entry-level positions. Some software developers may even start with bootcamps before pursuing undergraduate degrees.
